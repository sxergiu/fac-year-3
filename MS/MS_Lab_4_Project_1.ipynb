        "\n",
        "Welcome to **Lab 4** of the Modeling & Simulation course! In this laboratory session, we will build upon the foundations laid in the previous labs to enhance our bike-sharing system simulation. This lab introduces the concept of **time slot-specific probabilities**, allowing you to model varying bike usage patterns throughout the day. Additionally, you will implement bike maintenance and downtime, develop a rebalancing mechanism, track customer satisfaction, and undertake a **graded assignment** to design and implement a comprehensive simulation project.\n",
