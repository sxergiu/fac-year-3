        "## Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "This section is an explanation of the system you'll be working with. There aren't any problems to solve. Read it carefully anyway.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem set will make use of a *production rule system*. The system is given a list of rules and a list of data. The rules look for certain things in the data -- these things are the *antecedents* of the rules -- and usually produce a new piece of data, called the *consequent*. Rules can also delete existing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, rules can contain variables. This allows a rule to match more than one possible datum. The consequent can contain variables that were bound in the antecedent.\n",
        "\n",
        "A rule is an expression that contains certain keywords, like IF, THEN, AND, OR, and NOT. An example of a rule looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "     IF( AND( 'parent (?x) (?y)',\n",
        "              'parent (?x) (?z)' ),\n",
        "         THEN( 'sibling (?y) (?z)' ))\n",
        "\n",
        "This could be taken to mean:\n",
        "\n",
        "   If *x* is the parent of *y*, and *x* is the parent of *z*, then *y* is the sibling of *z*.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Given data that look like '`parent marge bart`' and '`parent marge lisa`', then, it will produce further data like `'sibling bart lisa`'. (It will also produce '`sibling bart bart`', which is something that will need to be dealt with.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, the rule system doesn't know what these arbitrary words \"parent\" and \"sibling\" mean! It doesn't even care that they're at the beginning of the expression. The rule could also be written like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "    IF (AND( '(?x) is a parent of (?y)',\n",
        "             '(?x) is a parent of (?z)' ),\n",
        "        THEN( '(?y) is a sibling of (?z)' ))\n",
        "\n",
        "Then it will expect its data to look like '`marge is a parent of lisa`'. This gets wordy and\n",
        "involves some unnecessary matching of symbols like '`is`' and '`a`', and it doesn't help anything for\n",
        "this problem, but we'll write some later rule systems in this English-like way for clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just remember that the English is for you to understand, not the computer.\n",
        "    \n",
        "## Rule expressions\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a more complete description of how the system works.\n",
        "\n",
        "The rules are given in a specified order, and the system will check each rule in turn: for each rule, it will go through all the data searching for matches to that rule's antecedent, before moving on to the next rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "A rule is an expression that can have an IF antecedent and a THEN consequent. Both of these parts are required. Optionally, a rule can also have a DELETE clause, which specifies some data to delete.\n",
        "\n",
        "The IF antecedent can contain AND, OR, and NOT expressions. AND requires that multiple statements\n",
        "are matched in the dataset, OR requires that one of multiple statements are matched in the dataset, and\n",
        "NOT requires that a statement is *not* matched in the dataset. AND, OR, and NOT expressions can be\n",
        "nested within each other. When nested like this, these expressions form an AND/OR tree (or really an AND/OR/NOT tree). At the bottom of this tree are strings, possibly with variables in them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data are searched for items that match the requirements of the antecedent. Data items that appear earlier in the data take precedence. Each pattern in an AND clause will match the data in order, so that later ones have the variables of the earlier ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "If there is a NOT clause in the antecedent, the data are searched to make sure that no items in the data match the pattern. A NOT clause should not introduce new variables - the matcher won't know what to do with them. Generally, NOT clauses will appear inside an AND clause, and earlier parts of the AND clause will introduce the variables. For example, this clause will match objects that are asserted to be birds, but are not asserted to be penguins:\n",
        "\n",
        "    AND( '(?x) is a bird',\n",
        "         NOT( '(?x) is a penguin' ))\n",
        "\n",
        "The other way around won't work:\n",
        "        \n",
        "    AND( NOT( '(?x) is a penguin' ), # don't do this!\n",
        "         '(?x) is a bird' )\n",
        "         \n",
        "The terms **match** and **fire** are important. A rule **matches** if its antecedent matches the existing data. A rule that matches can **fire** if its THEN or DELETE clauses change the data. (Otherwise, it fails to fire.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Only one rule can fire at a time. When a rule successfully fires, the system changes the data appropriately, and then starts again from the first rule. This lets earlier rules take precedence over later ones. (In other systems, the precedence order of rules can be defined differently.)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Running the system\n",
        "\n",
        "The procedure\n",
        "`forward_chain(rules, data, verbose=False)` will make inferences as described\n",
        "above. It returns the final state of its input data.\n"
