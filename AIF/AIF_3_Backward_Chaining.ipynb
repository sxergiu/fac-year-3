        "## Goal trees\n",
        "\n",
        "For the next problem, we're going to need a representation of goal trees. Specifically, we want to make trees out of AND and OR nodes, much like the ones that can be in the antecedents of rules. (There won't be any NOT nodes.) They will be represented as AND() and OR() objects. Note that both 'AND' and 'OR' inherit from the built-in Python type 'list', so you can treat them just like lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings will be the leaves of the goal tree. For this problem, the leaf goals will simply be arbitrary\n",
        "symbols or numbers like `g1` or `3`.\n",
        "\n",
        "An **AND node** represents a list of subgoals that are required to complete a particular goal. If all the\n",
        "branches of an AND node succeed, the AND node succeeds. `AND(g1, g2, g3)` describes a goal that is completed by completing g1, g2, and g3 in order.\n",
        "\n",
        "An **OR node** is a list of options for how to complete a goal. If any one of the branches of an OR node succeeds, the OR node succeeds. `OR(g1, g2, g3)` is a goal that you complete by first trying g1, then g2, then g3.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Unconditional success** is represented by an AND node with no requirements: AND(). **Unconditional failure** is represented by an OR node with no options: OR().\n",
        "\n",
        "A problem with goal trees is that you can end up with trees that are described differently but mean\n",
        "exactly the same thing. For example, `AND(g1, AND(g2, AND(AND(), g3, g4)))` is more reasonably expressed as `AND(g1, g2, g3, g4)`. So, we've provided you a function that reduces some of these cases to the same tree. We won't change the order of any nodes, but we will prune some nodes that it is fruitless to check.\n",
        "\n",
        "*We have provided this code for you*. You should still understand what it's doing, because you can benefit from its effects. You may want to write code that produces \"messy\", unsimplified goal trees, because it's easier, and then simplify them with the `simplify` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how we simplify goal trees:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If a node contains another node of the same type, absorb it into the parent node. So `OR(g1, OR(g2, g3), g4)` becomes `OR(g1 g2 g3 g4)`.\n",
        "2. Any AND node that contains an unconditional failure (OR) has no way to succeed, so replace it\n",
        "with unconditional failure.\n",
        "3. Any OR node that contains an unconditional success (AND) will always succeed, so replace it\n",
        "with unconditional success.\n",
        "4. If a node has only one branch, replace it with that branch. `AND(g1)`, `OR(g1)`, and `g1` all represent the same goal.\n",
        "5. If a node has multiple instances of a variable, replace these with only one instance. `AND(g1, g1, g2)` is the same as `AND(g1, g2)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We've provided an abstraction for AND and OR nodes, and a function that simplifies them. There is nothing for you to code in this section, but please make sure to understand this representation, because you're going to be building goal trees in the next section. Some examples:\n",

        "    simplify(OR(1, 2, AND())) => AND()\n",
        "    simplify(OR(1, 2, AND(3, AND(4)), AND(5))) => OR(1, 2, AND(3, 4), 5)\n",
        "    simplify(AND('g1', AND('g2', AND('g3', AND('g4', AND()))))) => AND('g1', 'g2', 'g3', 'g4')\n",

        "\n",
        "In this problem, we will do backward chaining by starting from a conclusion, and generating a goal tree of *all* the statements we may need to test. The leaves of the goal tree will be statements like '`opus swims`', meaning that at that point we would need to find out whether we know that Opus swims or not.\n",

        "\n",
        "* You will never have to test a hypothesis with unknown variables. All variables that appear in the\n",
        "antecedent will also appear in the consequent.\n",
        "* All assertions are positive: no rules will have DELETE parts or NOT clauses.\n",
        "* Antecedents are not nested. Something like `(OR (AND x y) (AND z w))` will not appear in the antecedent parts of rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that an antecedent can be a single hypothesis (a string) or a RuleExpression.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The backward chaining process\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the general idea of backward chaining:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Given a hypothesis, you want to see what rules can produce it, by matching the consequents of\n",
        "those rules against your hypothesis. All the consequents that match are possible options, so you'll collect their results together in an OR node. If there are no matches, this statement is a leaf, so\n",
        "output it as a leaf of the goal tree.\n",
        "* If a consequent matches, keep track of the variables that are bound. Look up the antecedent of\n",
        "that rule, and instantiate those same variables in the antecedent (that is, replace the variables with\n",
        "their values). This instantiated antecedent is a new hypothesis.\n",
        "* The antecedent may have AND or OR expressions. This means that the goal tree for the antecedent is already partially formed. But you need to check the leaves of that AND-OR tree, and recursively backward chain on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other requirements:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The branches of the goal tree should be in order: the goal trees for earlier rules should appear\n",
        "before (to the left of) the goal trees for later rules. Intermediate nodes should appear before their\n",
        "expansions.\n",
        "* The output should be simplified as in the previous problem (you can use the `simplify` function). This way, you can create the goal trees using an unnecessary number of OR nodes, and they will be conglomerated together nicely in the end.\n",
        "* If two different rules tell you to check the same hypothesis, the goal tree for that hypothesis should be included both times, even though it seems a bit redundant.\n",

        "## Some hints from the Production code\n",
        "\n",
        "`match(pattern, datum)` - This attempts to assign values to variables so that *pattern* and *datum* are the same. You can `match(leaf_a, leaf_b)`, and that returns either `None` if `leaf_a` didn't match `leaf_b`, or a set of bindings if it did (even empty bindings: `{}`).\n",

        "\n",
        "NOTE: `{}` and `None` are both `False` expressions in python, so you should explicitly check if match's return value is `None`. If `match` returns `{}`, that means that the expressions match but there are no variables that need to be bound; this does not need to be treated as a special case.\n",
        "\n",
        "`populate(exp, bindings)` - given an expression with variables in it, look up the values of those variables in *bindings* and replace the variables with their values. You can use the bindings from `match(leaf_a, leaf_b)` with `populate(leaf, bindings)`, which will fill in any free variables using the bindings.\n",
